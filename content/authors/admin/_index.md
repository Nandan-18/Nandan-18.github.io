Exploring deep into the various fields of science and its mysteries has always been my passion, my ambition and the driving force of my life.
I have been a practical learner all my life and have always tried to implement my knowledge in real-life and day-to-day situations.

I believe, with the advancing science and technology in hand, we humans can solve any challenge that gets thrown at us or ones that are awaiting us in the future, and I strive to be part of this mission to make the world a better place.

Apart from academics, experimenting and toying with computer hardware and technology has always been my interest and hobby.
I am also a fitness freak and love playing basketball regularly.
